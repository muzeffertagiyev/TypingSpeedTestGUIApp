# Typing Speed Test Application

The Typing Speed Test Application is a simple Python-based desktop application that allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The application presents users with a random set of words, and they are required to type those words as quickly and accurately as possible.

## Features

- Randomly generates a set of words for the user to type.
- Measures the number of correct words per minute.
- Counts the number of incorrect words typed.
- Displays an efficiency percentage, indicating how much the user's typing speed has improved since the last attempt.
- Provides a countdown timer of 60 seconds for the typing test.
- Offers the ability to restart the test and close the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your computer.
3. Run the `main.py` script to launch the application.
4. Click the "Start The Test" button to begin the typing test.
5. The application will display a set of random words that you need to type as quickly as possible.
6. Type the words in the input field provided and press the spacebar after each word.
7. The timer will count down from 60 seconds, after which the test will end automatically.
8. Once the test ends, the application will display the number of correct words per minute and the number of incorrect words typed.
9. It will also show an efficiency percentage, indicating your improvement compared to the last attempt.
10. You can restart the test or close the application using the corresponding buttons.
